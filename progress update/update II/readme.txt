Hi Jonathan & ZenBen


Questions:

	- Do we need a unique identifier?
	- Money $$$ for MTurk
	- Do you want a display bar?



PhD Programs:
I'm growing increasingly interesting in PhD programs - particularly specialised research units/teams (Gatsby/DeepMind/CSAIL labs/MIT Media Lab).
I understand the first step is to do great masters work, but these courses are so competitive I think it might be useful to be more strategic and deliberate.

As established academics I'm certain you both have insight/direction as to how I can maximise my chances of being selected for one of these programs. As such:
1. If you have any advice as to how I can better my chances any assistance would be highly appreciated throughout the year.
2. If you have any additional small projects
