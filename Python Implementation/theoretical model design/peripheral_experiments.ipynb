    "It may be worth modelling fitts law with a series of flexible basis functions or ridge regression, to gauge how the size of the components or position on the screen plays a role in the candidates ability to complete the task, however a simple average deviation from expected response time (in miliseconds) should be sufficient as a proxy for thier comfortability with thier computer.\n",
