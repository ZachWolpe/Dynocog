Eye-hand coordination is the important and complex way we respond to
objects we see. For example, if you want to grasp a coffee cup in
front of you, you (unconsciously!) estimate the distance between your
hand and the cup and make a movement. This seemingly trivial task has
been studied in depth by psychologists interested in eye-hand
coordination and motor control.

The American psychologist Paul Fitts published about how difficult it
is to move our hand towards an object in the 1950s and his
mathematical description is known as Fittsâ€™s Law.
